description:You will learn how to do simple math formuluas: supscripts, superscripts, series and sums, integrals, derivatives, etc.
---

title:Symbols
---
id:1
---
target: $\alpha + \beta + \gamma = \pi$
---
hint:
---
comment: Enclose your formula with dollar signs: \dollar ... \dollar.
Use \bs{alpha} for $\alpha$, and so on.
---

title:Integrals
---
id:1.1
---
target: $$\int x dx$$
---
hint:
---
comment: Here you will need \code{\bs{int}} for $\int$.  Snippets of
LaTeX code like \code{\bs{int}}  are called \italic{macros}.

This time, put your LaTeX code betwen double dollar signs:
\dollar\dollar .. \dollar\dollar.  This is \italic{display math mode}.
---

title:Spacing
---
id:1.2
---
target: $$\int x\ dx$$
---
hint:
---
comment: Sometimes you need to adjust the spacing.  If you put \code{\bs{space}}
between the \code{x} and the \code{dx}, the formula will look better.
You can also put a backslash followed by a space.
---

title:Superscripts
---
id:2
---
target:Pythagoras said that $ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $
---
hint:
---
comment:Use \code{^} for superscripts, e.g, \code{x^2} for $x^2$.
Notice the form: ordinary text, with the mathematics
between dollar signs. This is \italic{inline math mode} once again.
---

title:Superscripts and Integrals
---
id:2.1
---
target:$$
\int x^2 dx
$$
---
hint:
---
comment:You know what to do here!  Combine what you know
about symbols with what you know about superscripts.

This is \italic{display math mode} once again.
---


title:Fractions
---
id:2.2
---
target:$$
\int x^2 dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C
$$
---
hint:
---
comment: You will need to use the \code{\bs{frac}} macro.  It works
like this: \code{\bs{frac}\texarg{numerator}\texarg{denomianator}}.

If you don't like the looks of the result, try putting the macro
\code{\bs{small}} just before the \code{\bs{frac}}.
---

title:Subscripts
---
id:3
---
target:$$
a_1, a_2, a_3
$$
---
hint:Use \code{_} for subscripts, e.g., \code{a_1} for $a_1$.
---
comment:Use \code{_} for subscripts, e.g., \code{a_1} for $a_1$.
\code{\ldots}  is a \italic{macro}.  It puts three dots along
the baseline.There are lots of these!  Notice the double dollar signs.
This is \italic{display math mode}.
---

title:On and on
---
id:3.1
---
target:$$
a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots
$$
---
hint:Use \code{_} for subscripts, e.g., \code{a_1} for $a_1$.
---
comment:\code{\ldots}  is a \italic{macro}.  It puts three dots along
the baseline.There are lots of these!
---

title:Subscripts and superscripts
---
id:4
---
target:$$
a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2 + \ldots
$$
---
hint:The previous two problems gave you what you need to do this one.
---

title:Complex subscirpts
---
id:4.1
---
target:$$
a_{10}^2 + a_{11}^2 + a_{12}^2 + \ldots
$$
---
hint:The previous two problems gave you what you need to do this one.
---
comment:When the subscript consists of more than a single character
or entity, enclose it in curly braces, like this:
\code{x_\texarg{abc}} for $x_{abc}$.
---

title:Sums
---
id:5
---
target:$$
\sum_{i=0}^6 a_i
$$
---
hint:Use curly braces to group the parts of the subscript, like this
\code{\texarg{i=0}}.
---
comment:Sums follow the same pattern as integrals, except
that you use \code{\bs{sum}} in place of \code{\bs{int}}. Oh ...
remember what we said earlier about complex subscripts.
---

title:An infinite sum
---
id:5.1
---
target:$$
\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i
$$
---
hint:
---
comment:Use \code{\bs{infty}} for $\infty$.
---



title:Harmonic series
---
id:5.1
---
target:$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \small\frac{1}{n}
$$
---
hint:
---
comment:You know everything you need for this one!
